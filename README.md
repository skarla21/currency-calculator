## About

Currency Calculator is a full stack application that helps manage currency exchanges with a user-friendly interface. The backend, powered by Express on Node.js, offers comprehensive CRUD operations along with user authentication and security measures. It connects to Mongo Atlas for data storage using Mongoose schemas and also manages sessions via Mongo Store. Authentication and cookies are managed with passport. The frontend is developed with React, Material UI and TypeScript using Vite and is hosted on Vercel. It communicates with the backend for all operations, and certain actions are protected based on the user's authentication status.
